# Recursive Directory Backup

This script watches a directory recursively for changes and backs them up with timestamped filenames.

## Requirements

- watchdog

`pip install watchdog`


## Usage

Replace `/path/to/watched_directory` and `/path/to/backup_directory` with your paths. Customize the `exclude_files` list with filenames or regex patterns to exclude specific files.
